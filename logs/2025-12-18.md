## On last data acquired
- Data acquired at max Grid V on [2025-12-12](../logs/2025-12-12.md) is  Vgrid=345 V, Vanode=345 V, Vcathode=1325 V.
- Timepix3 threshold was set at 1550 THL (3346.2 e-)
- For this config, nearest simulated Efield is 62505.51925274 V/cm with alpha = 1007.72574464 per cm. For a polya with theta=0.9, there is 98.9% chance to miss detection of single electron avalanche ![image](../plots/polya_distribution_gas_multiplication_ArDME_8020_Grid345V_THL1550.pdf).


## Operations
- [11:30] HV unit on, LV unit on, Ar flushing started at 80 ccpm (10x200 mL requires 2000mL=2000cc/80ccpm = 25 min)
- [17:08] LV and FEC on, this time connected to white plugs (not UPS). Noise scan suggested by Alda. Noise looks better, but could be due to pixels masked during previous run. NoiseScan_2025-12-18_17-11-47.pdf
- [17:19] Noise scan after LV powered through white plugs and a filter by Alda. Not much improvement. NoiseScan_2025-12-18_17-20-03.pdf
- [17:33] Noise scan after both LV and FEC powered though white plugs and filters by Alda. Noise deteriorated. NoiseScan_2025-12-18_17-33-01.pdf
- [17:38] Reomved filter of FEC. Filter of LV remains. .Sill deteriorated noise. Closed orange room door. NoiseScan_2025-12-18_17-42-03.pdf
- [17:45] Turned oof all lights, closed orange room door. Improved noise. Conifrm by repeating previous configuration.
- [17:52] Lights back on. Orange facility door shut. Remain same. Seems random.
- [18:07] Connected to Bonn FEC, A-card and SFP plug. No improvement in noise
- [18:19] Change to IAPS FEC, A-card and SFP plug. Change LV and FEC to Lab UPS.
- [18:57] Change to **Timepix3 of IAPS**, with MIMAS A7 readout and a different LV Psupply and USB to power MIMAS, do noise scan between 1368 to 1550
- [20:14] pixelDAC optimization THLL=1350 THHLH=2900 inj=100 mask=0. To run over night. Failed (in next log)

## Comparison with W15-G6 during 2024/12  ans 2023/10 Runs
- 2024/12 Run : THL was Coarse 6 Fine 383 -> THLcombined 1343 (from data set). Noise scan shows good noise levels at 1400 levels (from scan). No THL Calib to compare with electrons.
- 2023/10 Run : THLScan with vtpC=100, vtpF=300 [250 mV or 4700 e-], resulting THL 1713. No THLCalib available, with this year THL Calib 1295+0.08*e, it is 1665 THL. Check data for actual THL setting.
