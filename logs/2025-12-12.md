## Operations
- [12:07] Try tpx3_monitor from start_tpx3_monitor.py script in hmhpg10--longEthernet--NOVOOLantoUSB. 
- [12:30] Succesful in hmhpg10 with TPL Scan. **Online monitor to be launched first, then initate TP injection from another terminal after Hardware init**
- [12:33] **Installed in Lab PC IXPE and verified with TPL Scan**

## HV ON first time with Vlad online on Meet [14:00 to 16:30]
- Fe55 AN-7258 source placed on top on a Kapton tape (~ 1 cm air gap between tape and Be window)
- Configuration [Mask](../tpx3/20251212v2.h5), [Equalization](../tpx3/WorkingEqualisation-27-09-2025.h5), [DACSettings](../tpx3/20251212V1.TPX3)
- HV ramp up strategy: Grid/Anode same and Cathode -50 V wrt them untill ~-300 V. Start online_monitor. Then increase Cathode to ~-1000 V (500 V/m) and establish drift field. Increase Anode/Grid in small steps of 10 V. The followed ramp up procedure is in [Spreadsheet](../results/GridPix_rampup_rampdown_20251212.xlsx)
- At intermediate steps of ramp up, hot pixels that triggered a lot were masked on the fly. Final mask is [MaskFile](../tpx3/20251212v2.h5)
- Till we started to see the events significantly, hits were monitored on personal Laptop (hmhpg10). Then three data sets acquired on Lab PC.
- DataTake_2025-12-12_15-50-12.h5 : 325 V, 325 V, 1325 V (Grid CH3, Anode CH2, Cathode CH1) [Plots](../results/DataTake_2025-12-12_15-50-12/)
- DataTake_2025-12-12_15-57-03.h5 : Transition: 325 V, 325 V, 1325 V --> 335 V, 335 V, 1325 V --> 345 V, 345 V, 1325 V [Plots](../results/DataTake_2025-12-12_15-57-03/). Lightcurve shows transition in count rate.
- DataTake_2025-12-12_16-01-03.h5 : 345 V, 345 V, 1325 V [Plots](../results/DataTake_2025-12-12_16-01-03/)
- Ramp down procedure followed reverse of [Spreadsheet](../results/GridPix_rampup_rampdown_20251212.csv)
- Looks like approaching the proper operating voltages.
- [19:30] LV, HV, Gas, Flowmeter all turned off and disconnected over the weekend.
- Realized that Flowmeter logging that started on 2025-12-09 stopped on 2025-12-10 (*log file from Flowsuite to be added later*). The pressure, however, remained stable at 1.1? bar, verified visually on the pressure gauge on gas flow pipeline.
