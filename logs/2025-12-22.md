## Setup and Tests for Tube
- [12:00] Tested voltages of the X-ray tubes. -60V (fineTuneAnodeCathode), Grid 100V (field shaper), +12V, 0V (Thermionic),  1 kV on HV monitor.
- [12:10] **Hamamatsu 8 kV with Cu anode (max 2 W)**, with Cu tape at exit to filter Bremstrahlung.
- [12:10] Newport XYDU set to home and XYSO set to (0,13 mm).
- [12:30] Amptek CdTe XR100 + PX4 detector acquired 5.89 keV (Kalpha), 6.5 keV (Kbeta) lines with 55Fe.

## Tube On
- [14:17] XYDU (12,12) XYSO (0,-8 mm)
- [14:20] Switch on Grid G2 +100 V, Switch on Multimeter, then G1 -60 V, Switch on 12 V (Thermionic heater). 
- [14:24] HV ramping started from 0 kV. HV = 1 kV, I = 0. HV does not increase, later functionality restored.
- [14:35] HV = 12 kV, I = 0. Grid G1 = -60 V. No line in Amptek CdTe.
- [14:36] Reducing Grid Voltage target -19.4 V. Adjust Newport coordinates (xdu, ydu) = (2,-8) and (xso, yso) = (0,13).
- [14:38] Grid G1 -15.8 V. Amptek CdTe shows two lines, main at ~8.1 and another at ~9.2 keV. 8 keV line count rate is ~200 cts/s. Data saved in LabPC2.
- [14:52] Grid Voltage back to -60 V, count rate back to 0. DME flow started.
- [15:11] GridPix Ramp-up start [RampLog](/hv_ramp_logs/hv_log_2025-12-22_15-11-08.csv)

## GridPix configuration
Ar/DME 160/40 ccpm 1.1 bar, MIMAS A7 readout.

## Major data sets (Match filename with [RampLog](/hv_ramp_logs/hv_log_2025-12-22_15-11-08.csv) for HV settings)
- [DataTake_2025-12-22_15-44-02](../results/DataTake_2025-12-22_15-44-02) (~40 s) and DataTake_2025-12-22_15-54-37 (few minutes) : 55Fe in 415,415,1325V configuration
- [DataTake_2025-12-22_15-57-18](../results/DataTake_2025-12-22_15-57-18) (~50 s) and DataTake_2025-12-22_15-57-57 (few minutes) : 55Fe in 420,425,1400V configuration. No noticeable increase in gain.
- DataTake_2025-12-22_16-09-24 and DataTake_2025-12-22_16-11-30: Hamamatsu 8 keV Cu Anode spot beam due to a diaphragm at the end of collimator right before the Cu filter. It was removed from hereon.
- DataTake_2025-12-22_16-22-47 to DataTake_2025-12-22_16-53-34 : At Grid G1 voltage of -15.8 V, the count rate is very high that time clustering fails and FPGA gives data discard errors. An operable count rate was achieved at Grid voltage of ~ -20 to -21V (TBC).
- Diaphragm data DataTake_2025-12-22_16-09-24 and DataTake_2025-12-22_16-11-30. Tube on, off cycle.
- [DataTake_2025-12-22_16-53-34](../results/DataTake_2025-12-22_16-53-34) (~20 s sample data at Tube Grid G1 voltage of -15.8 V and Grid,Anode,Cathode = 420,425,1400V)
- **3x 15 minutes of data acquired (2.1 GB each) in the final configuration  DataTake_2025-12-22_16-58-40, DataTake_2025-12-22_17-13-46, DataTake_2025-12-22_17-28-59**
- To be analyzed, spatially resolved gain map. Pixel averaged spectrum looks smeared.
- [18:00] GridPix ramped down, Tube turned off, DME turned off, Ar flushing at 40 ccpm.
- [19:18] LV off, MIMAS A7 off.
