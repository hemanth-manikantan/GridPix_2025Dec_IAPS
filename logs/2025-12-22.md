## Setup and Tests for Tube
- [12:00] Tested voltages of the X-ray tubes. -60V (fineTuneAnodeCathode), Grid 100V (field shaper), +12V, 0V (Thermionic),  1 kV on HV monitor.
- [12:10] **Hamamatsu 8 kV with Cu anode (max 2 W)**, with Cu tape at exit to filter Bremstrahlung.
- [12:10] Newport XYDU set to home and XYSO set to (0,13 mm).
- [12:30] Amptek CdTe XR100 + PX4 detector acquired 5.89 keV (Kalpha), 6.5 keV (Kbeta) lines with 55Fe.

## Tube On
- [14:17] XYDU (12,12) XYSO (0,-8 mm)
- [14:20] Switch on Grid G2 +100 V
- [14:22] Switch on Multimeter, then G1 -60 V Alind?
- [14:23] Switch on 12 V (Thermionic heater)
- [14:24] HV ramping started from 0.
- [14:24] HV = 1 kV, I = 0. HV does not increase, later functionality restored.
- [14:35] HV = 12 kV, I = 0. Grid G1 = -60 V. No line in Amptek. Adjust newport (add later coordinates)
- [14:36] Reducing Grid Voltage target -19.4 V.
- [14:38] Grid G1 -19.4 V. Amptek CdTe shows line count rates of ~200 cts/s. Data saved in LabPC2.
- [14:52] Grid Voltage back to -60 V, count rate back to 0. Now open DME, start Gridpix Ramp up.
