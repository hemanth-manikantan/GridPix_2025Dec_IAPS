## Operations 
[11:18] Check conductivity of Be window Cathode. Proper conductivity (less than few ohms) exist between Be window and Copper cathode verified using a multimeter and Solder wire.
[12:06] Remove Cathode connection flat head screw 1 mm in Orange facility
[12:56] Cathode with Mylar/Al swapped with Be window in IXPE clean room. The Mylar/Al cathode is left in the clean room. Cathode reconnected in Orange facility [Original](../images/GridPix_og_cathode_20251209_122539.jpg),[Disassembled](../images/GridPix_noCathode_20251209_123524.jpg), [Be-Cathode](../images/GridPix_BeCathode_20251209_124320.jpg).
[14:10] HV sample volt setup to verify HV connections Ch1/Ch2/Ch3 Cathode/Anode/Grid -20/-15/-10V. HV unit output different voltages (verified with open probing), for eg. -14 for -10 V, -10 to -15V for -15 V, -20 for -20 V settings. HV unit requires warm up, was just switched on! GridPix shows same readings. Indicates the **HV connections are good**.
[14:15] Setting up flusing with gas by the time HV unit stabilize
[14:55] GridPix fixed on the Orange facility Translation/Rotation stage. Washer used for one plastic screw because bottom thread blocked. Gas pipeline connected.
[15:05] Pressure retention test **success** with Ar 50 ccpm 1.1 bar, atmosphere reading shown by Bronkhorst 1.01 bar (~1mBar overpressure)
[15:08] Started flushing Argon in the detector ar 50 ccpm 1.1 bar
[16:25] LV and FEC connected to the detector and turned on.
[16:25] Link 2 has a problem also in this setup. Clicking Link2 in Expert settings return commandline error 'Error: Unknown link status'. Try changing the DP cable to Etseinri 8K.
[16:45] DP cable changed. LV 3.3V/0.218A, 1.52/0.448, 1.52/0.099 mA. **success** all chip links available with **Etseinri 8K** DP cables.
[16:47] Mask and Equalization changed to *WorkingMask-27-09-2025.h5* and *WorkingEqualisation-27-09-2025.h5*. From visual inspection of the mask, new mask seems to mask more pixels (superset including old mask pixels).

## Scans
[16:51] Noise Scan THL 1343 to 1600, shutter 0.01
