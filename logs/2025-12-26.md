## Aim
- Oxford Tube 17 keV UP FF at missing config from previous day 410/460/2460 eps=0deg
- Hamamatsu Cu tube at four configurations 410/460/2460, 410/510/2460, eps=0deg and eps=-90deg

- [12:30] Ar turned on 40 ccpm. By mistake pressurized window to 1.1 mBar due to Bronkhost Flowmeter off.
- [15:18] DME on round 2.
- [16:03] Ramp-up after hiccup
- [16:21] DME round 3
- [16:38] OxfordTube 4 uA
- [16:57] 410/510/2510
- [17:26] DME round 4
- [17:43] 410/460/2460
- [18:15] HV Ramped down. Ar/DME still flowing at 460/40 ccpm but DME at 0 bar.
- [18:57] DME still preserves flow, oscillates between 39--41. Switch off DME.
