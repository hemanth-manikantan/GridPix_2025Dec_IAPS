## Leftovers
2025-12-10 [10:45:11] THL calibration finished [THLCalib](../plots/ThresholdCalib_2025-12-09_19-06-58.pdf). Results THL =  *(1295.641 ± 1.754) + (0.078 ± 0.000)THL/e-*. A *mistake* was made, global THL was set at 1425, so the low tail of THL distribution is cut. Should not impact the THL calibration results though, as it is estimated from the center of the distribution!

## Scans
- [11:55] THL Scan to check TPA to THL conversion. For 1000 e- (typical expected signal from avalanche), required VtpF DAC is 221.36 for VtpC DAC 100, expected THL is ~~1683~~. THL Scan settings VtpC=100, VtpF=221, nTP=100, mask=16, THLstart=1600, THLend=1760 (THL spread is about 45 from [THLCalib](../plots/ThresholdCalib_2025-12-09_19-06-58.pdf)). Results: Empty plot [THLScan](../plots/ThresholdScan_2025-12-10_11-55-39.pdf). Wrong THL estimate.
- [12:22] Repeat THL Scan to check TPA to THL conversion. For 1000 e-, required VtpF DAC is 221.36 for VtpC DAC 100, expected THL is 1373. THL Scan settings VtpC=100, VtpF=221, nTP=100, mask=16, THLstart=1325, THLend=1425. Result 1357 \pm 40. Reference [THLScan](../plots/ThresholdScan_2025-12-10_12-22-31.pdf).
- [12:32] THL Scan to check TPA to THL conversion with DAC 0.5 mV assumption. For 1000 e-, required  VtpF DAC is 306.80 for VtpC DAC 100, expected THL is 1683. THL Scan settings VtpC=100, VtpF=307, nTP=100, mask=16, THLstart=1600, THLend=1760. Result 1687 \pmn 42. Reference [THLScan](..plots/ThresholdScan_2025-12-10_12-31-43.pdf)
# 2.5 mV TP DAC : THL range 1296 to 2911 corresponds to 4.6 to 20845.06 e-, 12.82 e- per THL DAC step. Noise cut THL DAC 1550 is then 3282.35 e-
# 0.5 mV TP DAC : THL range 1296 to 2911 corresponds to 0.9 to 4169 e-, 2.56 e- per THL DAC step. Noise cut THL DAC 1550 is then 656.47 e-

## First HV
- [13:44] DME cylinder open to gas pipeline at 2.5 mBar. Already 50ccpm flowing Ar reset to 160 ccpm and DME 40 ccpm.
- [15:00] HV ON Google Meet with Vlad. Skipped HV ON because **tpx3_monitor** does not launch *Segmentation fault (core dumped)*

## Mask iteratively pixels to try lower the THL
- [12:51] THL 1550 data acqusition (DataTake_2025-12-09_17-33-12.h5) from [2025-12-09](../logs/2025-12-09.md). 11 pixels are triggered ([ 53 214], [205  50], [247 249], [ 26 128], [ 35 209], [ 47 208], [182 155], [249  57], [ 87 209], [ 77  41]). Masking them.

## DAC verification with TPL scan
- [16:53] For 4500 electrons, required VtpF DAC is 296.12 for VtpC DAC 100. Expected threshold from Bonn fit is 1644.36 THL.
- [17:00] THL 1645, TPL scan VtpC 100, vtpF 250 to 350 (125 to 375 mV) (2340.82 e to 7022.47 e). S curve crosses in the range means threshold is in this TP range. Reference [TPLScan](../plots/TestpulseScan_2025-12-10_17-04-28.pdf)
- ~~[17:20] Same TP in -ve polarity. VtpC = 200, VtpF from 288 to 325. In principle this hould have encompassed the previous curve, but it has not.~~
- ~~[17:25] DAC 0.5 mV interpretatiion: For 900 e, required VtpF DAC is 296.12 for VtpC DAC 100. Expected threshold from HeAl fit is 1644.36 THL. TPL scan VtpC 100, vtpF 280 to 312 (750 e to 1050 e).~~

## Reinstall tpx3-daq to recover tpx3_monitor
[20:14] Unsuccesful. Possible culprit *Qt*.

## Scans
- [20:15] Run THL calibration at low THL ranges overnight. THL range 1300--1500, 16 itr, 12 data points. THL calibration will run overnight.
