## From yesterday
2025-12-05 00:59:02 Equalization finish. Reason Narrow range. Next try 1290 to max.

## Scans
- 12:11 Noise scan THL 1290 to 1575, shutter 0.01. 
Frequent decode errors : [FifoReadout    ] - WARNING There were 0 discard errors and 255 decode errors - Resetting error counters. Probably the FPGA overflow due to noise at low thresholds. 
Wrong equalization file.
- 12:17 Equalization reverted to - Equalization W15-G6_equal-Bonn.h5 (from Markus?)
- 12:18 Noise scan THL 1290 to 1575, shutter 0.01. [FifoReadout    ] - WARNING There were 0 discard errors and 1275 decode errors - Resetting error counters
- 12:20 During noise scan 3.3V/0.219A, 1.523V/0.078A, 1.521V/0.209A
- 12:26 tpx3_gui crash   File "/home/ixpe_user/tpx3-daq/tpx3/analysis.py", line 298, in save_and_correct

- 14:35 THL Scan for 200e, VtpC 100 VtpF 221 [(221-2*100)*0.5e-3*3e-15/1.602e-19] assuming 0.5 V VtpF DAC. VtpF changed 300-->221. THL Scan 1290-1450, 100 tp, 1/256 column mask [Intermediate run during Noise scan analysis]
