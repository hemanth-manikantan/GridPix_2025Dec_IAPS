## Leftovers from 2025-12-09
- 2025-12-10 TPL calibration finished, however the TP range exceed the given THL range of 1300 to 1500 (Reference [THLCalibration](../plots/ThresholdCalib_2025-12-10_20-17-13.pdf)). 
- As per [tpx3-daq docs](https://tpx3-daq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/scans.html#thl-calibration), VTP_coarse is always set to 100 (500 mV) and VTP_fine is calculated by VTP_fine=240 + $\frac{100}{steps}\times$ iteration.
- For 12 data points, VTP_fine are `[ 40,  48,  56,  64,  72,  80,  88,  96, 104, 112, 120, 128]`. They correspond to `[1872.4  2246.88 2621.36 2995.84 3370.32 3744.8  4119.28 4493.76 4868.24 5242.72 5617.2  5991.68]` e- for 2.5 mV DAC step. As per the previous [THLCalibration](../plots/ThresholdCalib_2025-12-09_19-06-58.pdf), this in THL are `[1441.6882 , 1470.89764, 1500.10708, 1529.31652, 1558.52596, 1587.7354 , 1616.94484, 1646.15428, 1675.36372, 1704.57316, 1733.7826 , 1762.99204]`. *Therefore, only the first three data points and the tail of 4th data point are in the range of THL 1300 to 1500* and this is visible in the plot  [THLCalibration](../plots/ThresholdCalib_2025-12-10_20-17-13.pdf).

## DAC verification with TPL scan, continuation from [2025-12-10 17:00](../logs/2025-12-10.md)
- [16:30] Try to achieve the same TPA 125 to 375 mV, but this time with negative polarity. That is, a signal centered around *+4500 e* (1644.36 THL) with TPA in range -125 to -375 mV (-2340.82 to -7022.47 e). It should have the same THL crossing at  as injected testpulse is bipolar. The corresponding DAC setting for 2.5 mV DAC step, for vtpC=100  are VtpF 50 to 150 (-375 to -125 mV) (-7022.47 to -2340.82 e)
- [16:45] TPL scan. 1645 THL, TPL scan VtpC 100, vtpF 50 to 150. Reverse S-curve appears, expected. Reference [TPLScan](../plots/TestpulseScan_2025-12-11_16-48-41.pdf)
- [17:00] TPL scan with a different VtpC 200, but same (-375 to -125 mV) (-7022.47 to -2340.82 e). VtpF DAC 250 to 350 THL 1645. Reverse S-curve appears, expected. Reference [TPLScan](../plots/TestpulseScan_2025-12-11_17-01-47.pdf)
- [17:13] TPL scan with a different VtpC 0, but positive same (125 to 375 mV) (2340.82 to 7022.47 e). VtpF DAC 50 to 150 THL 1645. S-curve appears, expected. Reference [TPLScan](../plots/TestpulseScan_2025-12-11_17-12-34.pdf)
- **TPL (vtpC, vtpF) shows consistent THL beahaviour in TPL Scans, verified for THL 1645**
