## Aim
- Hamamatsu Cu 8.05 keV 410/510/2510. Acquire two data sets at Tube 12kV/-20.5V and 12kV/-20.9V

# GridPix setup
- Ar 40 cppm flowing over night.
- Ar/DME 160/40 1.1 bar.

## Preparations
- [09:45] Oxford Mo tube dismounted
- [10:00] Hamamatsu tube mounted, CdTE X123 mounted, 55 Fe verified with CdTe X123
- [10:06] Hamamatsu tube turned on. 12 kV/-20.5. 
- [10:10] CdTe ct rate 830 cts/s. CdTe circle area = 3.14x0.25^2 CdTeQE=1.0. Gpix circle area = 3.14x0.5^2. GPix rate = 1.38x CdTe.
- [10:30] DME on. Ar/DME 160/40 ccpm.
- [10:39] Tube aligned with GridPix.

## Operations
- [10:54] Ramp-up start
- [11:13] Fe55 data good. Start Cu FF Up at -20.9V. Tube does not show events. HV auto lowered to 10 kV.
- [11:25] Problem with Hamamtsu HV. Meanwhile acquire 55fe data.
- [11:45] Identified the problem is with HV monitor. Probing with Brandenberg showed **HV=12.1kV at dial setting of 9.8kV**.
