## Aim
- Oxford Tube 17 keV UP FF at two configurations 410/460/2460 and 410/510/2460
- Oxford Tube Mo target, Cu+Zr Filters, Collimator

## Operations
- [13:51] Ar flushing at 40 ccpm overnight.
- [14:02] Rotation stage initialized to Home after dismounting GridPix off the 3 white plastic screws.
- [14:05] Dismounted Mo/LiF Cu+Zr spot tube to replace with Mo Cu+Zr with Brass collimator (Paolo Thesis) FF

## Try to reduce THL from 1360 (910 e-)
- [14:28] 199,32 95,96 71,96 51,223 48,47 47,113 245,127 73,32 85,225
- [14:41] **THL lowered to 1340 (654 e-) after masking above pixels, Noise rate is about 5 hits/s**
- Amptek CdTe for 30.5 kV, 100 uA --11k cts/s (97% DT), 1 uA (0 cts/s), 2 uA (1500 cts/s). Spectrum 17.4 keV + Kbeta + Bremstrahlung + Cu + 8 keV

## Operations
- [16:35] Ramped up to 460/510/2510 55Fe acquired. Data acquired 1x 15 mins 17.4 keV FF (600 cts/s).
- Today DME is pretty bad, dropped 0.4 bar from 1.2 bar in 10 mins.
- [17:01] Detector rotated epsilon -90. Data acquired 1x 15 mins with 17 keV FF. Data looks good.

## Voltage change 410/460/2460V
- [17:34] Data acquired with **17 keV FF only at epsilon -90** in 410/460/2460V
- [18:06] epsilon rotated back to 0 deg (home)
