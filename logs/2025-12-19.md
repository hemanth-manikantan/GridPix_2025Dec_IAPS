## Leftover
- PixelDAC optimization from yesterday overnight failed after two data points. The lower THL limit should have been extended to full range instead of 1350 to 2900?

## IAPS Timepix with keysight and RSPro Power Supply 
- [14:45] Connect IAPS Timepix to the same setup and do noise scan. Same LV and Comm connections, just chip changed. Do Noise Scan and three point THLCalib to estimate the noise cut threshold.
- [14:52] ~~Noise scan : 1350 to 1600 tpx3 config same as Bonn. Exceeded data length, no plot generated.~~
- [14:59] Noise scan : 1450 to 1600 tpx3 config same as Bonn. Very noisy, extend 1600 to see where is the cut. NoiseScan_2025-12-19_14-59-21.pdf
- [15:03] Noise scan : 1450 to 1750 tpx3 config same as Bonn. Noisy in this range Ref [NoiseScan](../plots/NoiseScan_2025-12-19_15-03-00_IAPSChip.pdf)
- [15:13] **THLCalib in same config takes some time, skip it and change to Table LV PS and MIMAS A7. Connections made.**
- [15:24] Noise scan : 1450 to 1750 tpx3 config same as Bonn. Error depth exceeded. No plot generated.
- [15:30] Noise Scan : 1700 to 1750, 1600 to 1750 tpx3 config same as Bonn. Significantly low Noise!. At 1700, Table LV + MIMAS makes 1 hot pixel, while Orange facility makes 200 hot pixels  [1700-1750](../plots/NoiseScan_2025-12-19_15-30-31.pdf), [1600-1750](..plots/NoiseScan_2025-12-19_15-32-04.pdf)
- [15:44] Replaced LV unit with the one on Table (RSPro). HV cables still connected.

## Bonn GridPix with RSPro & Keysight Power Supply, MIMAS and FEC, long and short Ethernet cables 
- [15:49] RSPro + FEC NoiseScan THL 1450 to 1600 [NoiseScan](../plots/NoiseScan_2025-12-19_15-49-22.pdf)
- [16:00] Keysight + FEC NoiseScan THL 1450 to 1600 [NoiseScan](../plots/NoiseScan_2025-12-19_16-01-52.pdf). No improvement, similar performance as RSPro + FEC.
- [16:08] Keysight + MIMAS A7 NoiseScan THL 1450 to 1600. Empty data set, probably MIMAS did not drive the long Ethernet cable? (How did Markus manage in the 2023 run?)
- [16:25] Keysight + MIMAS + Short black Ethernet cable with hmhpg10 laptop PC. Mask, Equalization, backup same. Noise Scan THL 1450 to 1600. Still no data in 1450 to 1600
- [16:28] **Keysight + MIMAS + Short black Ethernet cable with hmhpg10 laptop PC. Noise Scan from 1350 to 1450.** [NoiseScan](::/plots/NoiseScan_2025-12-19_16-27-16_Keysight_MIMAS_ShortEthernet.pdf)
- [16:33] On LabPC Keysight + MIMAS + Short black Ethernet cable with hmhpg10 laptop PC. Noise Scan from 1350 to 1450. [NoiseScan](../plots/NoiseScan_2025-12-19_16-33-24.pdf). Much better than FEC long line, thl cut at ~1360
- [16:45] Revert to Keysight + **FEC** + Short black Ethernet cable with hmhpg10 laptop PC. Noise Scan from 1350 to 1550. **Noise comes back THLcut 1550**
- [16:55]  Keysight + **FEC** + Short black Ethernet cable with hmhpg10 laptop PC + FEC PowerSupply Filter. Noise Scan from 1350 to 1550. No change, thlcut at 1550.
- [17:15] Alda connected the GND of FEC to the GND of Keysight PS. Noise Scan from 1350 to 1550. 
- [17:30] Trid with Bonn FEC as well. No improvement in Noise. It seems to be problem with grounding of the Power crate of FEC. About 10 mV (400 electrons) difference between various grounds are seen. For the moment, only MIMAS could be used.

## GridPix HV operation with MIMAS A7
- [17:51] Setup Keysight PS, MIMAS A7 (fw4), Lab PC
- [17:53] Add log from hmhpg10. 55Fe recorded
- [18:27] Ramp-up started, with data monitored in hmhpg10 [RampLog](../hv_ramp_logs/hv_log_2025-12-19_18-27-21.csv). Switched to lab PC at [19:00] (**Made a mistake resetting THL of labPC, hmhpg10 THL 1365 (~600 e-) while labPC THL 1550 (~3000 e-), result gaps in track**). Ramped up till Grd355,An355,Cath1325 V.
- [19:14] tpx3_monitor show horizontal pixelated pattern in both hmhpg10 (MIMAS+short ethernet) and labPC (MIMAS+long ethernet). [Screenshot](../results/glitches/Online_monitor_DataTake_2025-12-19_19-41-23.png) **However, analysis of acquired data does not show this pattern**
- Major data sets are
- [DataTake_2025-12-19_19-20-36](../results/DataTake_2025-12-19_19-20-36/) Last ramp-up step
- [DataTake_2025-12-19_19-36-14](../results/DataTake_2025-12-19_19-36-14/) Highest Grid Voltage 355V
- [DataTake_2025-12-19_19-41-23](../results/DataTake_2025-12-19_19-41-23/) Ramp-down
